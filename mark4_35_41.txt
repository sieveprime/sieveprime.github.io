# Mark 4:35-41

During our work retreat's Lectio Divina, we focused on the scripture passage from Mark 4:35-41.

Reflections placed on my heart by the Lord:

As the sea raged and the boat took on water, the Lord slept peacefullyâ€”a state unimaginable to anyone in such turmoil.
This demonstrates an extraordinary level of trust and faith.

Instead of succumbing to worry, I am reminded to have faith in the Lord, to grab a bucket, and begin bailing water from the boat.
This act symbolizes taking proactive steps in faith, rather than surrendering to despair.

We are called to remain at peace, just as our Lord did amidst the chaos of the thrashing sea.
When life's storms threaten to engulf us, we must trust that the Lord's peace will sustain us, keeping us from being dragged into the depths of despair.

Symbolically, the church can be seen as the boat, enduring the storms of life.
These storms, influenced by Satan, attempt to drag the boat to the depths and sink it.
Yet, with unwavering faith, the church remains steadfast, trusting in the Lord's peace and protection.
